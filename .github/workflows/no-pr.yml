      COMMENT: |
        Thank you for your contribution to our project.

        Our repositories hosted on GitHub are merely a mirror, a backup of our main repositories on GitLab.

        Please, submit your contributions to the corresponding repository on GitLab:

        <https://gitlab.com/veloren/>

        That said, this pull request will be closed automatically.
    steps:
      - name: Close the pull request with a comment
        run: gh pr close "${PULL_REQUEST_URL}" --comment "${COMMENT}"
